Open Terminal
Start login program
	  
Correctword = RandomWord from dictionary
List WordsOnScreen = 10 RandomWord from Dictionary with length == CorrectWord
Guesses = 0
	  
Function ChooseCorrectWord(UserChosenWord)
	while Guesses < 4 do
		if UserChosenWord not like CorrectWord
			output "incorrect, but X letters from UserChosenWord.Length are correct. 'Guesses' out of 4 left"
		else 
			output "You guessed the correct word, CorrectWord"
	end
			
	  
	  
	  
```
